   ```env
   # Telnyx Configuration
   TELNYX_API_KEY=your_telnyx_api_key
   TELNYX_ACCOUNT_SID=your_telnyx_account_sid
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TELNYX_JSON_TOKEN=your_telnyx_jwt_token

   # Heygen Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HEYGEN_API_KEY=your_heygen_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID=Santa_Fireplace_Front_public

   # Webhook Configuration
   WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.app  # For local testing
   # WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app     # For production
   ```

4. **Local Testing with ngrok**

   For local testing, use ngrok to expose your local server:
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok if you haven't already
   npm install -g ngrok

   # Expose your local server (in a separate terminal)
   ngrok http 3000

   # Copy the https URL and set it as WEBHOOK_BASE_URL in your .env
   ```

5. **Telnyx Configuration**

   **TeXML Application Setup:**
   - Configure your TeXML application to use: `${WEBHOOK_BASE_URL}/api/webhooks/telnyx`
   - The webhook handler will automatically route based on request content

   **WebRTC Setup:**
   - Create a SIP connection in your Telnyx console
   - Note your SIP credentials for WebRTC calls

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Usage

### Inbound Call Flow

1. **Incoming Call**: Calls arrive at your TeXML application endpoint
2. **Automatic Recording**: TeXML responds with Record instruction for transcription
3. **Call Transfer**: After 2 seconds, call is transferred to SIP agent endpoint
4. **Agent Alert**: Dashboard shows incoming call with Answer/Decline buttons
5. **Call Handling**: Agent can answer, hold, mute, or hang up calls
6. **Transcription**: Completed calls automatically generate transcripts and coaching

### Agent Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

1. **WebRTC Connection**: Dashboard automatically connects to Telnyx WebRTC
2. **Inbound Alerts**: Incoming calls display caller information with answer/decline options
3. **Outbound Calls**: Enter phone number and click "Make Call" for outbound
4. **Call Controls**: Use Hold, Mute, and Hang Up during active calls
5. **Real-time Status**: See call status, duration, and connection info

### AI Coaching (`/coaching`)

1. **Generate Coaching**: Paste a call transcript and click "Generate AI Coaching"
2. **Review Feedback**: See strengths, improvements, and suggestions generated by AI
3. **Avatar Session**: Click "Start Avatar Coaching" to begin interactive training
4. **Interactive Experience**: The Heygen avatar will deliver coaching content

## API Endpoints

### Coaching System
- `POST /api/coaching/generate` - Generate coaching content from transcript

### Unified Webhook Handler
- `POST /api/webhooks/telnyx` - Handles all Telnyx webhook types:
  - **Inbound calls**: Returns TeXML for recording and transfer
  - **Call status**: Processes call state changes
  - **Transcriptions**: Generates AI coaching from transcripts
  - **Generic events**: Handles unknown webhook types

### TeXML Integration
- Automatic call recording with transcription
- SIP call transfer to agent endpoints
- Status callbacks for call state tracking

## Development

### Testing
```bash
npm test          # Run Playwright tests
npm run test:ui   # Run tests with UI
```

### Building
```bash
npm run build     # Build for production
npm start         # Start production server
```

## Configuration Notes

### Telnyx Setup
1. Create a SIP Connection in your Telnyx console
2. Configure your connection with webhook URLs
3. Enable call recording and transcription if needed
4. Set up AI Inference API access

### Heygen Setup
1. Create a Heygen account and get API access
2. Configure your avatar and obtain the Avatar ID
3. Set up streaming permissions for your application

### Webhook Security
- Implement webhook signature verification in production
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Configure proper CORS settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Telnyx Connection Failed**
- Verify your API keys and public key are correct
- Check that your SIP connection is active
- Ensure webhook URLs are accessible

**Avatar Not Loading**
- Confirm Heygen API key and Avatar ID are set
- Check browser console for WebRTC/media permissions
- Verify Heygen account has streaming avatar access

**Webhook Not Receiving Events**
- Test webhook URLs are publicly accessible
- Check Telnyx console webhook configuration
- Verify webhook endpoints return 200 status

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set all required environment variables
2. **Database**: Replace file-based storage with PostgreSQL/MongoDB
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication
4. **SSL/TLS**: Use HTTPS for all endpoints
5. **Webhook Security**: Implement signature verification
6. **Monitoring**: Add logging and error tracking
7. **Scaling**: Consider containerization with Docker
