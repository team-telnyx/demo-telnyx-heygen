# Contact Center AI Coaching Application

## Overview

This application provides AI-powered coaching for contact center agents by leveraging call transcripts and Heygen Streaming Avatar technology to deliver personalized feedback and training after each customer interaction.

## Problem Statement

Contact centers face high agent turnover rates and need efficient training solutions. While AI assistants resolve 25% of requests, many calls still require human agents. This application addresses the need for scalable, personalized agent coaching using real call data.

## High-Level Architecture

The application consists of three main components:
1. **Real-time Call Interface** - Agent dashboard with AI insights
2. **Webhook Processing** - Call transcript handling and processing
3. **AI Coaching Module** - Avatar-based feedback and training delivery

## Core Features

- **Technology**: Telnyx Voice SDK (`@telnyx/webrtc`)
- **Functionality**: 
  - Real-time call handling interface
  - Display AI Assistant insights and transcripts during active calls
  - Provide context and recommendations to agents in real-time
  - Call controls (answer, hold, transfer, hangup)

### 2. Webhook Integration
- **Technology**: Next.js API routes
- **Functionality**:
  - Receive call completion webhooks from Telnyx
  - Process call transcripts automatically
  - Trigger coaching session generation
  - Store call data and coaching insights

### 3. AI Coaching System
- **Technology**: Heygen Streaming Avatar SDK
- **Functionality**:
  - Analyze call transcripts for coaching opportunities
  - Generate personalized feedback using AI
  - Present coaching through interactive avatar interface
  - Track agent improvement over time

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React-based)
- **WebRTC**: Telnyx Voice SDK
- **Avatar Integration**: Heygen Streaming Avatar SDK
- **UI Components**: Modern React component library (e.g., shadcn/ui)

### Backend
- **API**: Next.js API routes
- **Webhook Handling**: Express.js middleware or Next.js API handlers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for call data and coaching records
- **AI Processing**: OpenAI GPT or similar LLM for transcript analysis

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Voice Platform**: Telnyx Voice API
- **Avatar Technology**: Heygen Streaming Avatar
- **Analytics**: Optional dashboard for coaching effectiveness

interface CallRecord {
  id: string;
  agentId: string;
  customerId?: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  duration: number;
  transcript: string;
  aiInsights: string[];
  coachingGenerated: boolean;
  status: 'completed' | 'processing' | 'error';
}
```

### Coaching Session
```typescript
interface CoachingSession {
  id: string;
  callId: string;
  agentId: string;
  feedback: {
    strengths: string[];
    improvements: string[];
    suggestions: string[];
  };
  avatarScript: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```
